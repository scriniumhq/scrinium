// this struct. Unlike a serialization config it carries no tags and
// no store/policy concerns — only what the View and FSOps need.
//
// Zero values mean "engine default": an empty RootView selects the
// first available root, a zero ScratchQuota is unlimited, zero
// DefaultUID/GID fall back to the running process.

	// ProvidedViews are the views the host's extensions back, collected

	// capability (ADR-98) and forwarded here verbatim. The projection

	// supplied Path/CountKey without knowing the view's concept — it
	// names no extension view (ADR-89, Principle 10). Empty ⇒ only the
	// intrinsic views exist.

	// manifests it cannot place: "orphaned" or "synthetic".

// Config.ProvidedViews; Build forwards them to the read-side View. The
// type carries the view's whole layout as opaque functions so the
// projection materialises the tree without knowing its addressing
// scheme — it never names the view (ADR-89, Principle 10). It is a
// distinct type from the engine's so the projection takes no dependency
// on the extension/engine layer.
