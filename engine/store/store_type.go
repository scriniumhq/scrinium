// core holds the entire internal state of a Store. It is never
// exported and never returned directly: clients receive a Store
// interface from InitStore / OpenStore, implemented by the *store
// wrapper below, whose three facets (data/admin/system) all share one
// *core. Splitting the surface into facets keeps the artifact-facing
// methods (dataFacet) free of the administrative ones (adminFacet)
// while both operate on the same underlying state.
//
// Behaviour is split across sibling files by the facet each serves —
// data_*, admin_*, system_* — plus the lifecycle_/bootstrap_
// construction files. The private helpers (enterRead/Write/Admin,
// withWriteDEK, loadManifest, snapshotConfig, publish, …) stay on
// *core, reachable by every facet.
//
// Concurrency. state is guarded by stateMu; most data-path methods
// read it once at entry and proceed lock-free, so a long Put never
// blocks an admin state transition. Mutating admin methods hold the
// write lock for the transition only.
//
// Lock ordering — stateMu and cfgMu are each taken in isolation and
// released before returning, so they are never nested. The crypto
// material has its own mutex inside crypto.State (engine/store/internal/
// crypto); its methods take and release it entirely on their own, and the
// store never holds stateMu or cfgMu while calling into crypto.State, so
// that mutex is never nested with these two either.
