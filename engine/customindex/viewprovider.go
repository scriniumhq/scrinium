// ViewProvider is the optional capability by which an index extension
// contributes one or more named projection views (ADR-98). It is
// discovered by type-assertion at the assembly layer — exactly like
// Resolver / Indexer / Accessor — and is asserted off the registered
// CustomIndex. The projection library never sees this type: discovery
// lives at the composition root, which alone may import both the
// extensions and the projection (ADR-89; Principle 10 — the projection
// stays acyclic and extension-agnostic).
type ViewProvider interface {
	// ProvidedViews returns the view(s) this extension backs. Each names
	// a RootView and supplies the seam pieces the projection needs to
	// materialise that tree. Empty slice = the extension backs no view
	// (it occupies only the index axis).
	ProvidedViews() []ProvidedView

// ProvidedView describes one projection view an extension backs (ADR-98).
// The composition root collects these across installed extensions, unions
// them with the native (intrinsic) views, and feeds the projection. Root
// must be unique across installed extensions; the root rejects a collision.

	// or "by-namespace" (namespace). Unique across installed extensions.

	// Resolve extracts this view's key from a manifest during backfill:
	// (key, true) admits the artifact into the tree, ("", false) when the
	// manifest is opaque to this view. Pure — the same manifest must
	// always produce the same result (the view caches the decision). For
	// by-path this is vfsmeta.Resolver.

	// Label optionally maps a raw key segment to a display label (e.g.
	// nsid → human name via a registry). nil ⇒ the key is used verbatim
	// (by-path needs no mapping).
	Label func(key string) (label string, ok bool)

	// Metadata optionally provides bulk ext-block lookup so the backfill
	// fetches an artifact's custom-index block in one round-trip instead
	// of re-reading the manifest. Satisfied by an index that already
	// stores ext blocks (as fspathindex does). nil ⇒ the backfill reads via
	// the store. A miss falls back transparently — performance hint, not
	// a correctness requirement.
